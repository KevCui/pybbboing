## pybbboing
It's a simple python script which can obfuscate words and keep them readable. It's inspired by WordPress plugin [bbboning](http://www.oik-plugins.com/oik_shortcodes/bbboing-obfuscate-text-but-leave-it-readable/)

### Requirement
* python3

### How to use
- Copy your text into a <file>
- Run command:
```
pybbboing <file>
```

~$ pybbboing test

Accirdong to a reesarcher at "Crmiabdge Univyrsite", it doesn't mttaer in wichh odrer the lettres in a word are, the olny imoprtnat thing is taht the fsrit and lsat leettr be at the rhgit pcale. The rest can be a tatol mses and you can sitll read it wiohtut pmorleb. Tihs is bceause the hmaun mind does not read eervy ltteer by itself but the word as a wohle.

Accordnig to a rescaerher at Cambrgdie 'iUiversnty', it doesn't meattr in wihch oredr the letters in a word aer, the only iapormtnt tihng is taht the fsirt and last letter be at the rghit plaec.
